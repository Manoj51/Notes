# Intro to JS

### Key Ideas:

1. Load and go delivery
2. Loose typing
3. Objects as general containers
4. prototypal inheritance
5. lambda (functions as firstclass objects)
6. linkage through gloabl variables (Bad idea, security problems)

### Values:

1. Numbers
2. strings
3. Booleans
4. Objects
5. null
6. undefined

* Have to be very careful when dealing with floating point numbers (0.1 + 0.2 is not eq to 0.3).
* strings are immutable
* Everything else are objects.

### Objects:
Objects are dynamic objects
* unification of object and hashtable
* But no hash nature is visible


* Any variable can receive any kind of value.
* can have labelled loops.
